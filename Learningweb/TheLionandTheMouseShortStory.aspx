            <img alt="" class="auto-style1" src="images%20(2)/The%20Lion%20and%20The%20Mouse%20Short%20Story/2.jpg" /><br />
            There was a beautiful forest.<br />
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="auto-style1" src="images%20(2)/The%20Lion%20and%20The%20Mouse%20Short%20Story/3.jpg" /><br />
            There lived a mouse near a lion&#39;s cage.<br />
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="auto-style1" src="images%20(2)/The%20Lion%20and%20The%20Mouse%20Short%20Story/4.jpg" /><br />
            The mouse was very playful.<br />
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="auto-style1" src="images%20(2)/The%20Lion%20and%20The%20Mouse%20Short%20Story/5.jpg" /><br />
            One day the mouse went to lion&#39;s cage.<br />
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="auto-style1" src="images%20(2)/The%20Lion%20and%20The%20Mouse%20Short%20Story/6.jpg" /><br />
            Without knowing the lion&#39;s power it started to play over the lion.<br />
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="auto-style1" src="images%20(2)/The%20Lion%20and%20The%20Mouse%20Short%20Story/7.jpg" /><br />
            Lion suddenly woke up. It got angry and began to roar loudly.<br />
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="auto-style1" src="images%20(2)/The%20Lion%20and%20The%20Mouse%20Short%20Story/8.jpg" /><br />
            Lion caught the mouse and threatened that he would eat him.<br />
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="auto-style1" src="images%20(2)/The%20Lion%20and%20The%20Mouse%20Short%20Story/9.jpg" /><br />
            Mouse said sorry and pleaded the lion to leave him without eating.<br />
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="auto-style1" src="images%20(2)/The%20Lion%20and%20The%20Mouse%20Short%20Story/10.jpg" /><br />
            The lion took pity and let the mouse to go.<br />
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="auto-style1" src="images%20(2)/The%20Lion%20and%20The%20Mouse%20Short%20Story/11.jpg" /><br />
            Two days later, a hunter came to the forest.<br />
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="auto-style1" src="images%20(2)/The%20Lion%20and%20The%20Mouse%20Short%20Story/12.jpg" /><br />
            The hunter saw the lion and trapped it using his net.<br />
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="auto-style1" src="images%20(2)/The%20Lion%20and%20The%20Mouse%20Short%20Story/13.jpg" /><br />
            The hunter went to his village to find more people to kill the lion. Lion kept shouting for help.<br />
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="auto-style1" src="images%20(2)/The%20Lion%20and%20The%20Mouse%20Short%20Story/14.jpg" /><br />
            Mouse heard lion&#39;s cries and came to help him. It cut the net in to pieces and freed the lion.<br />
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="auto-style1" src="images%20(2)/The%20Lion%20and%20The%20Mouse%20Short%20Story/15.jpg" /><br />
            Finally, the lion escaped from the net.<br />
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="auto-style1" src="images%20(2)/The%20Lion%20and%20The%20Mouse%20Short%20Story/16.jpg" /><br />
            <br />
            The lion thanked the mouse for his help. Then, they two started to live as friends forever.<br />
